# Framer Project: GPhotos
A prototype that recreates some areas of Google Photos in Framer.

The goal of this project is to share a robust Framer prototype to be used for different purposes: teaching Framer; to demonstrate what Framer is capable of; analyzing the structure of a multiscreen prototype; experimenting with dynamic data (coming soon!); just for the sake of learning new things.
