# Framer Project: GPhotos
A prototype that recreates some areas of Google Photos in Framer.

The goal of this project is to share a robust Framer prototype to be used for different purposes:
- Teaching Framer.
- To demonstrate what Framer is capable of.
- Analyzing the structure of a multiscreen prototype.
- Experimenting with dynamic data (coming soon!).
- Just for the sake of learning new things.
